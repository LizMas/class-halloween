```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) 

library(gsheet)
library(tidyverse)

trains <- gsheet2tbl("1QV7o63fiZdNtMtLQfdwREapf8eYDjpfSRX0dgfNrB8A")

```

```{r}

lm(att_start ~ male, data = trains)

#ggplot(trains, aes(att_start)) +
 # geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

#use geom_jitter to check for overlap 

#ggplot(trains, aes(x = age, y = att_start)) +
 # geom_jitter()

#see if data fits prior expectation 

#trains %>% 
 # group_by(liberal) %>% 
  #summarise(avg = mean(att_start))

#same 

#trains %>% 
 # group_by(male) %>% 
  #summarise(avg = mean(att_start))

# you can explore by treatment and see that treated group started more liberal. 

#facet_wrap brings in another variable by using ~ in argument; stat = count error can be fixed by doing this: 

ggplot(trains) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = att_start)) +
  facet_wrap(~ male)
